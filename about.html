      Hi there! I'm Alex. I enjoy street fitness and tuning cars. I've been learning programming for two years, starting with Java and then Python. I'm skilled in Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Ruby, and React. I've also worked as a locksmith, car chip tuner, and warehouse manager. My life is a mix of staying fit, coding, and automotive adventures.
